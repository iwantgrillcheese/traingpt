    ## Why Brick Workouts Matter
    
    If you've ever jumped off the bike and tried to run, you know the feeling â€” heavy legs, awkward stride, and total confusion. That's exactly what a **brick workout** is for. The more you train it, the smoother the transition becomes.
    
    **Builds neuromuscular coordination** between bike and run  
    **Improves pacing and mental focus** under fatigue  
    **Rehearses transitions** to make race day feel automatic

    ## How to Structure a Brick Workout
    
    ### Sprint Distance Brick
    
    - **Bike:** 45â€“60 min with race effort intervals  
    - **Run:** 10â€“20 min off the bike at 5K effort
    
    ### 70.3 Brick
    
    - **Bike:** 2.5 hrs Zone 2 + 3Ã—20 min at race pace  
    - **Run:** 30â€“40 min with 3Ã—3 min building to pace  
    - **Coach Tip:** Donâ€™t just "finish the brick" â€” use it to practice fueling and transitions
    
    ---
    
    ## When to Do Brick Workouts
    
    Once a week is plenty. Try placing it:
    
    - ðŸš´ **On your long ride day** (with a short run)
    - ðŸ“† **During a midweek session** with intervals
    
    Even a 30-min ride + 10-min run builds adaptation.
    
    ---
    
    ## How to Make Bricks Suck Less
    
    - ðŸ‘Ÿ Set your run shoes near your bike  
    - ðŸ¥¤ Practice fueling as you plan to race  
    - ðŸ§Š Start slow â€” let your legs come around
    
    ---
    
    ## The Bottom Line
    
    Brick workouts are where races are won. Train the bike-to-run to feel smooth, confident, and race-ready.

      Motivation is fleeting. Discipline is built. Rather than relying on motivation spikes,
      triathletes should aim for habit-based consistency. Create frictionless routines: lay out gear,
      schedule sessions, and build accountability. Track your weekly progress and aim for consistency
      over perfection. Small wins daily > big efforts occasionally.

      Open water anxiety is real. To conquer it, start with frequent short swims in controlled
      conditions. Practice sighting every 6â€“10 strokes and simulate mass starts with training partners.
      Train in your race wetsuit often. Familiarity builds confidence â€” the more you expose yourself
      to open water, the more comfortable it becomes.

      Long rides deplete glycogen stores, stress your nervous system, and leave you in a
      state of suppressed immunity. Rebuild with high-carb refueling within 30 minutes post-ride,
      followed by protein. Sleep is your #1 recovery tool. If youâ€™re always wrecked post-ride,
      your fueling or sleep hygiene probably needs work.

      Cadence isnâ€™t just a number â€” it affects your efficiency and fatigue rate.
      High cadence (90â€“100 RPM) minimizes muscular fatigue and increases aerobic demand.
      Low cadence (60â€“75 RPM) builds strength but can burn out your legs. Vary cadence
      based on workout intent. And remember: your optimal cadence may not match the pros.

      Tapering allows fatigue to drop while maintaining peak fitness. Most triathletes taper
      too little or too late. Cut volume by 40â€“60%, maintain intensity, and prioritize sleep.
      You should feel antsy before race day â€” thatâ€™s a good thing. It means your body is ready.

      For sprint races, short sharp bricks (30 min ride + 1â€“2 mi run) with high intensity are ideal.
      For 70.3, your bricks should simulate race pacing and fueling. Try 2.5 hr ride + 30â€“40 min run
      at 70.3 effort. Mimic terrain and transitions to improve race-day readiness.

      Watts are important, but so is drag. A lower, more aero position can save minutes â€” even
      if it costs a few watts. Balance comfort with aero. Test in training. Invest in position
