    content: `## What Is an AI Triathlon Coach?

Imagine having a coach who never sleeps, adapts to your schedule, and personalizes your plan in seconds. That’s the power of an AI triathlon coach.

AI coaching uses advanced models to build plans based on your:
- Race distance and date
- Training experience and goals
- Available training hours and rest preferences

With TrainGPT, you get intelligent, structured, periodized plans that adjust to your life — not the other way around.

---

## Why It’s Better Than a Template

Most free plans are static. They don’t know your fitness level, your race date, or whether you’ve trained in three weeks. AI coaching adapts.

**With an AI triathlon coach, you get:**
- Personalized workouts tailored to your fitness
- Phase-based training (base → build → peak)
- Weekly adjustments and reroll options
- Integration with your Strava history

---

## How TrainGPT Works

TrainGPT combines real coaching logic with GPT-4-turbo to create realistic, human-quality training plans. It builds your week, explains your sessions, and even checks in via chat.

Behind the scenes:
- Thresholds and pacing inform intensity
- Load management prevents burnout
- Taper timing is based on your actual race

---

## Why It’s Not Just a Gimmick

AI coaching isn’t a fad. It’s the future. Real coaches use AI to save time. Athletes use it to save money and stay consistent. And TrainGPT is leading the way.

    content: `## How to Train for a 70.3: The Smart Way

Whether you're racing your first half Ironman or aiming for a PR, your 70.3 training plan should do three things:
1. Build endurance gradually
2. Include race-specific workouts
3. Respect your life schedule

---

## Weekly Structure (Sample)

Here's what a week in the final build phase might look like:

- **Mon** – Rest  
- **Tue** – Threshold bike (60–75 min)  
- **Wed** – Swim + short Z2 run  
- **Thu** – Threshold run (45 min)  
- **Fri** – Swim or recovery spin  
- **Sat** – Long ride + brick run  
- **Sun** – Long run (Z2)

---

## 12-Week Plan Phases

- **Weeks 1–4:** Aerobic base, easy volume  
- **Weeks 5–8:** Race pace bricks, tempo workouts  
- **Weeks 9–11:** Peak load, simulation days  
- **Week 12:** Taper & sharpening

---

## Fueling, Recovery, and Race Readiness

- Practice fueling during long workouts  
- Sleep 8+ hours in peak weeks  
- Don’t cram volume — consistency wins

The best plan is the one that fits your life, adapts to your needs, and gets you to the start line feeling strong. That’s why static PDF plans are outdated.

---

## What a Great Plan Includes

- **Periodization** (base → build → taper)
- **Intensity variation** (not just volume)
- **Race-specific prep** (terrain, pace, fueling)
- **Built-in rest** (every 7–10 days)

---

## Why TrainGPT Is Different

Instead of picking from a few fixed plans, TrainGPT builds one **just for you** based on:
- Race type and date
- Experience level
- Training availability
- Preferred rest day

---

## Don’t Guess — Personalize

If your plan doesn’t fit your body or schedule, you won’t follow it.

## Pros of AI Coaching

- 💸 **Affordable** (or free!)

## Who this is for

- First-time 70.3 athletes who can train 6–10 hours per week and want a clear path to race day.  
- Intermediate racers returning from a break who need structured progression without guessing paces.  
- Busy professionals who need efficient key sessions instead of random volume.

Your starting point should include the ability to run 40–50 minutes continuously, ride 90 minutes in Zone 2, and swim 1,500–2,000 yards/meters comfortably. If you are below that, add 2–3 ramp weeks before starting this block. Keep one full rest day per week unless life stress demands more.

---

## How the 12-week blueprint works

The plan follows three four-week blocks: foundation, build, and peak/taper. Each week includes two quality sessions, two supporting endurance days, one skills/recovery day, and one full rest day. Intensity cues use RPE, heart rate zones, or power:
- Z1–Z2 (easy aerobic): conversational effort.  
- Z3 (tempo): steady but controlled.  
- Z4 (threshold): 10K run effort or 95–100% FTP on the bike.

Weekly rhythm (example):
- **Mon:** Rest or mobility.  
- **Tue:** Bike quality (threshold or tempo).  
- **Wed:** Swim endurance + easy run.  
- **Thu:** Run quality (tempo/intervals).  
- **Fri:** Swim technique or recovery spin.  
- **Sat:** Long ride + brick run.  
- **Sun:** Long run (mostly Z2).

---

## Weeks 1-3: Foundation and skills

Goal: establish consistent frequency, refine technique, and harden connective tissue before adding intensity. Priorities:
- Swim 2–3x weekly with drills (catch-up, fingertip drag, sculling) for 300–600 yards each session.  
- Bike 2–3x with one 75–90 minute Z2 ride and a 60-minute cadence-focused ride (high RPM work).  
- Run 3x with strides twice weekly (6–8 × 20 seconds fast, full recovery) to keep leg speed without taxing the aerobic system.

Sample week highlight: Saturday long ride 90 minutes Z2, immediately followed by a 15–20 minute brick jog at relaxed effort. Sunday 60-minute Z2 run with 6 × 20-second strides in the final 15 minutes. Keep strength 2x weekly (30–40 minutes, hinge/squat/push/pull/core).

---

## Weeks 4-6: Aerobic build and threshold control

Goal: introduce controlled intensity while extending long sessions. Adjust weekly hours to 8–11 if recovery is solid. Key workouts:
- Bike: 2 × 12–15 minutes at 88–94% FTP with 5 minutes easy between, plus a weekly 2-hour Z2 ride.  
- Run: 3 × 8–10 minutes tempo (Z3) with 3 minutes easy; long run builds to 75–85 minutes mostly Z2.  
- Swim: one endurance set (e.g., 3 × 800 steady) and one quality set (e.g., 12 × 100 as 4 steady/4 pull/4 paddles at moderate effort).

Add a brick every other week: 90-minute ride with 3 × 10 minutes at 85–90% FTP, straight into a 25-minute run with the middle 10 minutes at steady tempo. Practice fueling on any session over 75 minutes (30–60g carbs per hour, electrolytes based on sweat rate).

---

## Weeks 7-9: Race specificity and brick confidence

Goal: simulate race effort, refine nutrition, and sharpen transitions. Weekly hours may touch 10–12 with careful sleep and fueling. Focus points:
- Long ride grows to 2.5–3 hours: 3 × 20 minutes at 80–85% FTP with 10 minutes Z2 between; include aero position practice.  
- Brick run: 35–45 minutes with the first 10 minutes easy, 20 minutes at projected race pace, finish easy.  
- Swim: continuous 2,500–3,000 session once per week to dial pacing; include sighting every 6–8 strokes in open water or during pull sets.

Run quality example: 5 × 1 mile at half-marathon effort with 2 minutes easy jog. Bike quality: 6 × 6 minutes at 95–100% FTP with 3 minutes recovery. Continue strength once weekly with lighter loads to protect joints.

---

## Weeks 10-11: Peak volume and rehearsal

Goal: confirm race fueling, pacing, and gear. Keep intensity sharp but respect recovery. Highlights:
- Simulation brick: 2.5-hour ride at 78–83% FTP with full race fueling, into a 50–60 minute run where miles 2–4 sit at race pace.  
- Open-water swim rehearsal with start speed (2 × 200 strong) then settle into 2,000 steady. Practice sighting, turns, and wetsuit comfort.  
- Race rehearse transitions: set up bike shoes, helmet, run shoes, and practice mounting/dismounting safely.

Protect sleep and hydration. If HRV or morning resting heart rate spikes, trim intervals rather than skip the whole day. Keep strides for neuromuscular sharpness but cap hard efforts at 20–25 minutes total per week.

---

## Week 12: Taper and race week execution

Goal: shed fatigue, keep feel, and arrive calm. Drop volume to ~50–60% while keeping short race-pace reminders. Checklist:
- Early week: 2 × 8 minutes at race bike power, 6 × 20-second run strides, 6 × 50 swim build.  
- Midweek: review gear, lube chain, check tires, confirm nutrition pack for bike/run.  
- Two days out: 30–40 minute bike with 3 × 3 minutes at race power; 20-minute jog with 4 × 20-second pick-ups.  
- Day before: 10–15 minute swim with a few 25s strong; short spin; 10-minute jog — all easy.

Set pacing targets: bike at 78–83% FTP (or upper Z2 HR), run the first 3 miles easy Z2 before easing into goal pace. Stick to fueling practiced in peak weeks and avoid new gear.

---

## Common mistakes

- **Treating every ride like a hammer session.** Save the hard work for planned quality days; keep easy days truly easy.  
- **Skipping fueling practice.** Gut training is as critical as interval work; rehearse 60–75g carbs/hour on long rides.  
- **Ignoring sleep during peak.** Seven hours is a floor, not a goal — aim for eight-plus in heavy weeks.  
- **Overloading the taper.** Adding “just one more” long run in week 12 steals freshness.  
- **Neglecting transitions.** Smooth mount/dismount practice saves more time than a marginal gain tire swap.

---

## FAQ

- **How many hours per week should I expect?** Most athletes will range from 6–12 hours, peaking in weeks 9–10. If life gets busy, trim accessory sessions before cutting key bricks.  
- **Do I need power to follow this?** No, but power helps. You can use heart rate and RPE: keep long rides in upper Z2 and quality near threshold.  
- **How fast should the long run be?** Comfortable Z2 with occasional strides; avoid tempo on the longest run to protect recovery.  
- **Can I swap days?** Yes — preserve spacing between hard sessions and keep the long ride before the long run when possible.  
- **What if I miss a week?** Resume with an easier week (repeat the last solid one) before jumping ahead.

## Who this is for

This pacing guide is built for athletes who know their functional threshold power (FTP) or at least have a recent 20–30 minute test. It also works if you pace by heart rate and RPE but want power-based guardrails. You should be comfortable with 2-hour rides in Z2 and a 30–40 minute brick run without cramping. The goal: finish the bike steady enough to run the first 3 miles in control.

---

## Power targets by FTP

Use these benchmarks as starting points and adjust for heat, terrain, and fitness:
- **Beginner/finishing focus:** 75–78% of FTP for 2.5–3 hours. Example: FTP 200 → ride 150–156 watts normalized.  
- **Intermediate/steady racer:** 78–83% of FTP for 2.3–2.7 hours. Example: FTP 240 → ride 187–199 watts normalized.  
- **Strong cyclist/experienced:** 83–86% of FTP for 2.1–2.5 hours if run durability is proven. Example: FTP 280 → ride 232–241 watts normalized.

Guidelines:
- Keep the first 20 minutes at the low end of your range while you settle nutrition and heart rate.  
- Cap surges: limit spikes to <110% FTP on hills and <105% on descents or headwinds.  
- Aim for a variability index (VI) near 1.05 on flat courses and ≤1.08 on rolling courses.

---

## Heart rate and RPE backup pacing

Electronics fail, heat rises, and races are unpredictable. Backstop your pacing with HR and RPE:
- **Warm conditions:** expect HR to drift 5–10 bpm by mid-ride; start conservative.  
- **General targets:** mid/upper Z2 for the first 45 minutes, inching toward low Z3 later if you’re well-fueled.  
- **RPE cues:** breathing should be rhythmic, conversation short but possible, and you should feel like you could extend the ride 30–45 minutes if needed.

If HR is unusually high early, reduce effort for 10–15 minutes, sip fluids, and reassess. If HR is suppressed but legs are heavy, spin 5 minutes at 95–100 rpm and recheck before adding power.

---

## Course profiles: flat vs. hilly

- **Flat or lightly rolling:** hold steady power and keep aero position. Use micro-breaks every 20–30 minutes to stand for 10–15 seconds without spiking power.  
- **Hilly courses:** cap climbs at 100–105% FTP for short pitches; on longer grades, stay within your target range and shift early to avoid grinding.  
- **Technical descents:** prioritize safety and free speed. If you soft-pedal downhills, keep cadence high before re-entering aero to avoid a heavy restart.

Pre-ride or virtually scout the course to spot sections where you’ll back off and where you’ll push. Mark these in your head unit as lap targets to avoid emotional pacing.

---

## Nutrition and cadence that support pacing

Pacing only works if fueling and cadence are consistent. Aim for:
- **Carbs:** 60–90g per hour depending on gut training; start within the first 15 minutes.  
- **Fluids:** 500–750ml per hour in temperate weather; increase in heat and include 400–800mg sodium per hour based on sweat rate.  
- **Cadence:** 80–95 rpm on flats; 75–85 rpm on climbs unless power drifts too high.  
- **Position:** stay aero for the majority of the ride; stretch briefly every 25–30 minutes to keep the run posture ready.

Test your exact mix during long rides and race simulations in training, not on race week. If you’re prone to GI issues, pair gels with small water sips and avoid dense solids late in the ride.

---

## Brick workouts to lock in race feel

Use these sessions to confirm your pacing before race week:
- **Controlled race power brick:** 2:00 ride at 78–83% FTP with nutrition exactly as planned, into a 30-minute run where minutes 5–20 sit at goal half Ironman pace.  
- **Over/under control:** 5 × 10 minutes at 90% FTP with 5 minutes at 75% between; practice smoothing power in and out of efforts. Finish with 20 minutes easy jogging.  
- **Heat rehearsal:** if racing hot, ride 90 minutes in similar conditions with your race fluids; monitor HR drift and adjust expectations.

Log how your legs feel in the first 2 miles of each brick. If cadence was jumpy or HR drifted high, adjust your target downward by 2–3% and retest the following week.

---

## Common mistakes

- **Starting too hard in the first 30 minutes.** This quietly sabotages the run even if power looks fine.  
- **Ignoring headwind returns.** Athletes often overspend on the way out and crawl home; cap power when the wind is at your back so you can hold steady into the headwind.  
- **Skipping hydration in cool weather.** Dehydration still happens at 60°F; drink on a schedule, not by thirst alone.  
- **Riding out of aero during nutrition.** Practice drinking and eating while aero; sitting up each time adds minutes.  
- **No plan for cramp warning signs.** If calves twinge, increase cadence, take sodium, and back power 5% for 10–15 minutes.

---

## FAQ

- **What if I don’t know my FTP?** Do a 20–30 minute time trial, take 95% of average power, and use the beginner ranges until you have more data.  
- **Should I ride by normalized or average power?** Use normalized power for pacing decisions and watch VI to stay steady; average can mislead on hilly courses.  
- **How do I handle legal drafting zones?** Ride your plan. If you need to pass, do it decisively without spiking above 110% FTP for more than 15–20 seconds.  
- **What if my heart rate is unusually low?** Check nutrition, stand for 20–30 seconds to reset legs, then test a short surge. If HR stays low but you feel fine, continue within power targets.  
- **How soon should I start fueling?** Within the first 10–15 minutes; set a timer every 10–12 minutes to alternate carbs and fluids.

If you’re building toward a sprint, Olympic, or long-course race and want fitness that actually holds up, base training is your foundation. This guide is for age-group triathletes who have 8–16 weeks before race-specific work and want to use that time wisely instead of logging random miles.

---

## Who this is for

You’re a busy athlete who can train 5–10 hours per week, wants steady progress without injury, and prefers structure that respects work and family. You should be able to swim 1,000–1,500 yards/meters comfortably, ride 60–75 minutes in Z2, and run 30–40 minutes without stopping. If you’re rebuilding from time off, add two lighter weeks before jumping into higher volume.

---

## Why base training matters

Base training builds the aerobic engine that makes later intensity meaningful. Benefits include:
- Increased capillary density and mitochondrial efficiency for better endurance.  
- Improved fat utilization, which preserves glycogen for race-day surges.  
- Stronger tendons and ligaments from controlled, repeatable load.  
- Skill development in all three sports without the pressure of peak workouts.

Think of base as the runway for faster sessions later. Without it, threshold work turns into survival and recovery drags on for days.

---

## How long your base should last

The ideal duration depends on your race calendar and background:
- **Novice or returning after layoff:** 10–12 weeks of base before race-specific build.  
- **Intermediate with consistent training:** 8–10 weeks, with short intensity touches to keep speed.  
- **Advanced with deep durability:** 6–8 weeks of focused aerobic work can be enough if your year includes multiple races.

Use a 3:1 pattern (three progressive weeks, one deload) or a 2:1 if life stress is high. During deload weeks, cut volume 25–35% and keep two short intensity reminders (strides or 2–3 minute tempo efforts). The goal is to finish base feeling eager, not cooked.

---

## Weekly structure that keeps you fresh

Aim for repeatable rhythms rather than heroic days. Example 7–9 hour base week:
- **Mon:** Rest or 30–40 minutes mobility + easy swim drills.  
- **Tue:** Bike 60–75 minutes Z2 with 3 × 5 minutes low-cadence strength (65–70 rpm). Optional 15-minute transition jog.  
- **Wed:** Swim endurance set 2,000–2,800 steady + 6 × 20-second run strides later.  
- **Thu:** Run 45–65 minutes Z2 with short hills (8 × 30 seconds controlled).  
- **Fri:** Optional easy spin 40 minutes or technique swim; keep effort light.  
- **Sat:** Long ride 90–150 minutes mostly Z2 with 10–15 minute tempo insert.  
- **Sun:** Long run 50–75 minutes Z2; include 10 minutes form drills and 6 × 20-second pick-ups.

Adjust the order around your life but preserve spacing between hard sessions. Keep most efforts conversational; the goal is frequency and durability, not hitting PRs.

---

## Swim, bike, and run focus areas

- **Swim:** 2–3 sessions weekly. One technique-heavy (drills + short build 50s), one endurance main set (e.g., 4 × 600 steady), and optional pull buoy/paddles for strength. Practice sighting every 6–8 strokes if you have open water access.  
- **Bike:** Two endurance rides and one strength-oriented session. Low-cadence intervals (5–8 minutes at 70–80% FTP, 60–70 rpm) build torque without big heart rate cost. Keep aero position practice light but consistent.  
- **Run:** Three runs: short technique day with drills/strides, one aerobic maintenance run, and one longer aerobic run. Sprinkle hill strides to develop elastic recoil safely.

Keep a simple note after each session: sleep, mood, soreness, and what felt easy or hard. That log guides adjustments more than any fancy metric.

---

## Strength and mobility without excess fatigue

Strength twice weekly is enough in base. Focus on:
- Hinge (RDL or hip hinge), squat pattern, horizontal/vertical push and pull.  
- Core anti-rotation (pallof press), carries, and hip stability (single-leg balance work).  
- Mobility: thoracic rotation, ankle dorsiflexion, and hip flexor opening to hold aero position longer.

Sessions should last 30–45 minutes and finish well before you’re exhausted. If lifting leaves you flat for two days, trim volume and keep a rep or two “in the tank.” Base is about repeatability, not soreness.

---

## Testing and micro-adjustments

Light testing during base keeps you honest without derailing recovery:
- Every 3–4 weeks: 20-minute bike test or 8–12 minute hill repeat to gauge power/HR trends.  
- Run: 30-minute steady effort (not all-out) to see if pace at Z2 HR is improving.  
- Swim: 3 × 300 descending or a 1,000 steady TT to track pacing consistency.

If paces stagnate and fatigue rises, you may need more sleep or a bigger deload. If progress is steady, keep intensity minimal and let volume do the work. Only add threshold sessions once you’re handling your long ride and long run without lingering soreness.

---

## Common mistakes

- **Turning base into secret race pace training.** Staying mostly aerobic now sets up faster gains later.  
- **Letting frequency slide.** Three runs beat one heroic run; same for swimming.  
- **Skipping fueling on long rides.** Even base rides need 40–60g carbs/hour to protect recovery.  
- **Ignoring form.** Drills, strides, and mobility keep technique sharp as volume rises.  
- **Overloading strength.** Five heavy lifts a week belong in the off-season, not mid-base.

---

## FAQ

- **Can I include tempo during base?** Yes, in small doses: 10–20 minutes per week sprinkled into rides or runs keeps the system responsive without hijacking recovery.  
- **What if I only have 5 hours per week?** Prioritize three runs (one long-ish), two bikes (one 75–90 minutes), and one swim. Keep double days short.  
- **Do I need a formal deload week?** If you’re sleeping well and feel fresh, mini-deload every fourth week. If life is hectic, use a 2:1 pattern.  
- **How do I know base worked?** Pace or power at the same heart rate improves, long sessions feel routine, and you bounce back within 24–36 hours.  
- **When should I shift to build?** Once you can handle your target long ride/run and feel stable, introduce race-specific intervals and longer bricks.
