    content: `## What Is an AI Triathlon Coach?

Imagine having a coach who never sleeps, adapts to your schedule, and personalizes your plan in seconds. That’s the power of an AI triathlon coach.

AI coaching uses advanced models to build plans based on your:
- Race distance and date
- Training experience and goals
- Available training hours and rest preferences

With TrainGPT, you get intelligent, structured, periodized plans that adjust to your life — not the other way around.

## Why It’s Better Than a Template

Most free plans are static. They don’t know your fitness level, your race date, or whether you’ve trained in three weeks. AI coaching adapts.

**With an AI triathlon coach, you get:**
- Personalized workouts tailored to your fitness
- Phase-based training (base → build → peak)
- Weekly adjustments and reroll options
- Integration with your Strava history

---

## How TrainGPT Works

TrainGPT combines real coaching logic with GPT-4-turbo to create realistic, human-quality training plans. It builds your week, explains your sessions, and even checks in via chat.

Behind the scenes:
- Thresholds and pacing inform intensity
- Load management prevents burnout
- Taper timing is based on your actual race

---

## Why It’s Not Just a Gimmick

AI coaching isn’t a fad. It’s the future. Real coaches use AI to save time. Athletes use it to save money and stay consistent. And TrainGPT is leading the way.

    content: `## How to Train for a 70.3: The Smart Way

Whether you're racing your first half Ironman or aiming for a PR, your 70.3 training plan should do three things:
1. Build endurance gradually
2. Include race-specific workouts
3. Respect your life schedule

---

## Weekly Structure (Sample)

Here's what a week in the final build phase might look like:

- **Mon** – Rest  
- **Tue** – Threshold bike (60–75 min)  
- **Wed** – Swim + short Z2 run  
- **Thu** – Threshold run (45 min)  
- **Fri** – Swim or recovery spin  
- **Sat** – Long ride + brick run  
- **Sun** – Long run (Z2)

---

## 12-Week Plan Phases

- **Weeks 1–4:** Aerobic base, easy volume  
- **Weeks 5–8:** Race pace bricks, tempo workouts  
- **Weeks 9–11:** Peak load, simulation days  
- **Week 12:** Taper & sharpening

---

## Fueling, Recovery, and Race Readiness

- Practice fueling during long workouts  
- Sleep 8+ hours in peak weeks  
- Don’t cram volume — consistency wins
