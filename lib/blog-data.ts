    content: `## What Is an AI Triathlon Coach?

Imagine having a coach who never sleeps, adapts to your schedule, and personalizes your plan in seconds. That’s the power of an AI triathlon coach.

AI coaching uses advanced models to build plans based on your:
- Race distance and date
- Training experience and goals
- Available training hours and rest preferences

With TrainGPT, you get intelligent, structured, periodized plans that adjust to your life — not the other way around.

---

## Why It’s Better Than a Template

Most free plans are static. They don’t know your fitness level, your race date, or whether you’ve trained in three weeks. AI coaching adapts.

**With an AI triathlon coach, you get:**
- Personalized workouts tailored to your fitness
- Phase-based training (base → build → peak)
- Weekly adjustments and reroll options
- Integration with your Strava history

---

## How TrainGPT Works

TrainGPT combines real coaching logic with GPT-4-turbo to create realistic, human-quality training plans. It builds your week, explains your sessions, and even checks in via chat.

Behind the scenes:
- Thresholds and pacing inform intensity
- Load management prevents burnout
- Taper timing is based on your actual race

---

## Why It’s Not Just a Gimmick

AI coaching isn’t a fad. It’s the future. Real coaches use AI to save time. Athletes use it to save money and stay consistent. And TrainGPT is leading the way.

    content: `## How to Train for a 70.3: The Smart Way

Whether you're racing your first half Ironman or aiming for a PR, your 70.3 training plan should do three things:
1. Build endurance gradually
2. Include race-specific workouts
3. Respect your life schedule

---

## Weekly Structure (Sample)

Here's what a week in the final build phase might look like:

- **Mon** – Rest  
- **Tue** – Threshold bike (60–75 min)  
- **Wed** – Swim + short Z2 run  
- **Thu** – Threshold run (45 min)  
- **Fri** – Swim or recovery spin  
- **Sat** – Long ride + brick run  
- **Sun** – Long run (Z2)

---

## 12-Week Plan Phases

- **Weeks 1–4:** Aerobic base, easy volume  
- **Weeks 5–8:** Race pace bricks, tempo workouts  
- **Weeks 9–11:** Peak load, simulation days  
- **Week 12:** Taper & sharpening

---

## Fueling, Recovery, and Race Readiness

- Practice fueling during long workouts  
- Sleep 8+ hours in peak weeks  
- Don’t cram volume — consistency wins

The best plan is the one that fits your life, adapts to your needs, and gets you to the start line feeling strong. That’s why static PDF plans are outdated.

---

## What a Great Plan Includes

- **Periodization** (base → build → taper)
- **Intensity variation** (not just volume)
- **Race-specific prep** (terrain, pace, fueling)
- **Built-in rest** (every 7–10 days)

---

## Why TrainGPT Is Different

Instead of picking from a few fixed plans, TrainGPT builds one **just for you** based on:
- Race type and date
- Experience level
- Training availability
- Preferred rest day

---

## Don’t Guess — Personalize

If your plan doesn’t fit your body or schedule, you won’t follow it.

## Pros of AI Coaching

- 💸 **Affordable** (or free!)

    content: `## Triathlon Training Plan: Start With Structure, Not Guesswork

If you searched for a triathlon training plan, you likely want one thing: a clear roadmap that gets you to race day confident and healthy.

A good plan should help you:
- Build endurance without overtraining
- Improve swim, bike, and run efficiency
- Practice transitions and race fueling
- Peak at the right time with a smart taper

---

## Who This 16-Week Plan Is For

This framework works best for athletes who can train **6–10 hours/week** and have at least basic comfort in all three sports.

If you are brand new to swimming, spend 2–4 weeks on swim fundamentals first.

---

## Weekly Triathlon Training Plan Structure

A proven weekly structure:

- **Monday:** Rest or mobility + light strength
- **Tuesday:** Bike intervals + short transition run
- **Wednesday:** Technique swim + easy run
- **Thursday:** Tempo run + short strength session
- **Friday:** Endurance swim or recovery bike
- **Saturday:** Long ride + brick run
- **Sunday:** Long aerobic run

Keep most sessions easy (Zone 2), then layer in one to two quality sessions per week.

---

## 16-Week Progression (Base → Build → Peak → Taper)

### Weeks 1–6: Base
- Focus on aerobic consistency and technique
- Increase weekly volume by ~5–10% max
- Include one skills-focused swim and one long ride weekly

### Weeks 7–12: Build
- Add race-pace efforts and threshold work
- Extend brick sessions gradually
- Rehearse fueling every weekend

### Weeks 13–15: Peak
- Keep intensity, slightly reduce volume
- Prioritize race-specific sessions
- Practice open-water skills and transitions

### Week 16: Taper
- Reduce volume 40–60%
- Keep short efforts at race intensity
- Arrive fresh, not flat

---

## Common Mistakes That Break a Triathlon Training Plan

1. Doing every session too hard
2. Skipping easy days
3. Not practicing race fueling
4. Ignoring sleep and recovery metrics
5. Changing your plan every week without data

    content: `## 70.3 Training Plan: What Actually Works

A strong 70.3 training plan balances endurance, race-pace specificity, and recovery. Most athletes underperform not because they train too little — but because they train inconsistently or too hard.

---

## 20-Week 70.3 Training Plan Overview

Use this phase structure:

- **Weeks 1–8 (Base):** Aerobic capacity, swim form, durable run frequency
- **Weeks 9–15 (Build):** Longer bricks, threshold intervals, fueling practice
- **Weeks 16–18 (Peak):** Race-specific simulation sessions
- **Weeks 19–20 (Taper):** Freshen up while keeping rhythm

Typical weekly hours: **8 to 12**.

---

## Key 70.3 Workouts to Include Every Week

- **Long bike (2.5–4.5h)** with race-pace segments
- **Brick run (15–45 min)** immediately after key rides
- **Long run (75–120 min)** mostly easy aerobic
- **Threshold session** on bike or run (not both hard in same 24h)
- **2–3 swims** including one endurance set and one form/speed set

---

## 70.3 Fueling Benchmarks

Practice this in training so race day has no surprises:

- **Bike:** 60–90g carbs/hour + consistent hydration
- **Run:** 30–60g carbs/hour based on tolerance
- **Sodium:** Adjust to sweat rate and climate

Never test new nutrition in race week.

---

## Sample Build-Phase Week

- **Mon:** Recovery swim + mobility
- **Tue:** Bike threshold intervals (75 min)
- **Wed:** Easy run (50 min) + form swim
- **Thu:** Tempo run (60 min)
- **Fri:** Endurance swim + optional recovery spin
- **Sat:** Long ride (3.5h) + 30-min brick run
- **Sun:** Long run (95 min)

    content: `## Olympic Triathlon Training Plan (12 Weeks)

Training for an Olympic-distance triathlon requires precision: enough volume to build endurance, enough intensity to raise speed, and enough recovery to absorb the work.

---

## Weekly Framework

- **2–3 swims** (technique + threshold)
- **2–3 bikes** (one interval, one endurance)
- **3 runs** (easy, tempo, long)
- **1 rest day** minimum

Aim for **6–9 hours/week** depending on experience.

---

## Pace and Intensity Guidelines

- Keep ~80% of training easy aerobic
- Use tempo/threshold 1–2x weekly
- Keep quality sessions short and purposeful

For many athletes, better pacing alone can improve race-day time more than adding extra volume.

---

## Olympic Triathlon Race-Prep Checklist

- Practice open-water starts
- Rehearse T1 and T2 setup
- Test race-day breakfast and gels
- Include one simulation brick in final 3 weeks

- **Weeks 19–21:** Peak long sessions and pacing rehearsal
- **Weeks 22–24:** Taper and sharpen

Most athletes train **10–14 hours/week**, with occasional higher-volume weekends.

---

## Non-Negotiables in an Ironman Plan

- Weekly long ride with nutrition rehearsal
- Weekly long run mostly easy aerobic
- Regular open-water confidence work
- Mobility + strength 1–2x weekly
- One full rest day

---

## Long-Course Fueling Practice

Your race plan should be tested, not guessed:

- Carbohydrate targets by hour
- Hydration and sodium by temperature
- Caffeine timing if used

Practice exactly what you plan to execute.

    content: `## Triathlon Nutrition Plan Essentials

No triathlon training plan works if fueling is an afterthought.

Whether you are preparing for sprint, Olympic, 70.3, or full Ironman, nutrition should be trained just like pacing.

---

## Daily Training Nutrition Basics

- Prioritize consistent carbohydrate intake around key workouts
- Include 25–40g protein after hard sessions
- Stay hydrated throughout the day, not only during workouts

---

## Long-Session Fueling Practice

During long sessions, test:

- Carbs per hour you can absorb comfortably
- Fluid amounts by weather condition
- Sodium strategy based on sweat rate

Use training logs to track tolerance and performance.

---

## Race-Week Nutrition Priorities

- Reduce fiber 24–48h pre-race if GI-sensitive
- Keep meals familiar and simple
- Carb-load progressively for longer events
- Avoid trying new products late
