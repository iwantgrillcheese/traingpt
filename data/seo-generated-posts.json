It works for beginners who need guardrails and experienced athletes who want a more precise progression.\n\n## Key Training Principles\n1. **Periodization:** split training into base, build, peak, and taper.\n2. **Volume progression:** increase gradually to avoid injury and excessive fatigue.\n3. **Intensity distribution:** most sessions easy, one to two key workouts each week.\n4. **Recovery discipline:** adaptation happens between sessions, not during them.\n\n## The Training Plan\n| Week | Focus | Key Sessions | Weekly Volume |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Base | 1 quality + 1 long + easy support runs | 4.5-6.0 hrs |\n| 2 | Base | Slight long-run progression + strides | 5.0-6.5 hrs |\n| 3 | Build | Threshold/tempo progression | 5.5-7.0 hrs |\n| 4 | Deload | Reduced load and reduced long run | 4.0-5.0 hrs |\n| 5 | Build | Specific endurance and race-pace work | 6.0-7.5 hrs |\n| 6 | Build/Peak | Long session specificity | 6.5-8.0 hrs |\n| 7 | Peak | Simulation and sharpening | 7.0-8.5 hrs |\n| 8 | Taper | Lower volume + freshness | 4.0-5.5 hrs |\n\nWeekly volume should be adjusted to your current baseline and recovery capacity.\n\n## How to Customize the Plan\n- Start from your current weekly average, not an aspirational number.\n- Keep hard days separated by easy or recovery days.\n- Move sessions around work/family constraints while preserving sequence.\n- Practice race fueling in long sessions, not only on race day.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n- Stacking too much intensity in one week.\n- Making long runs too hard too often.\n- Skipping deload weeks.\n- Ignoring sleep and hydration.\n\n## FAQ\n### 8 week triathlon training plans with pace guidance\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\n### 8 week triathlon training plans pdf\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\n### 8 week triathlon training plans free template\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\n### 8 week triathlon training plans with taper\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\nRelated reading: [AI triathlon coach](/blog/ai-triathlon-coach), [adaptive training plan](/blog/ai-vs-human-coach), [best triathlon training plan](/blog/best-triathlon-training-plan).\n\nReady for your exact version?

It works for beginners who need guardrails and experienced athletes who want a more precise progression.\n\n## Key Training Principles\n1. **Periodization:** split training into base, build, peak, and taper.\n2. **Volume progression:** increase gradually to avoid injury and excessive fatigue.\n3. **Intensity distribution:** most sessions easy, one to two key workouts each week.\n4. **Recovery discipline:** adaptation happens between sessions, not during them.\n\n## The Training Plan\n| Week | Focus | Key Sessions | Weekly Volume |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Base | 1 quality + 1 long + easy support runs | 4.5-6.0 hrs |\n| 2 | Base | Slight long-run progression + strides | 5.0-6.5 hrs |\n| 3 | Build | Threshold/tempo progression | 5.5-7.0 hrs |\n| 4 | Deload | Reduced load and reduced long run | 4.0-5.0 hrs |\n| 5 | Build | Specific endurance and race-pace work | 6.0-7.5 hrs |\n| 6 | Build/Peak | Long session specificity | 6.5-8.0 hrs |\n| 7 | Peak | Simulation and sharpening | 7.0-8.5 hrs |\n| 8 | Taper | Lower volume + freshness | 4.0-5.5 hrs |\n\nWeekly volume should be adjusted to your current baseline and recovery capacity.\n\n## How to Customize the Plan\n- Start from your current weekly average, not an aspirational number.\n- Keep hard days separated by easy or recovery days.\n- Move sessions around work/family constraints while preserving sequence.\n- Practice race fueling in long sessions, not only on race day.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n- Stacking too much intensity in one week.\n- Making long runs too hard too often.\n- Skipping deload weeks.\n- Ignoring sleep and hydration.\n\n## FAQ\n### 8 week triathlon training plans pdf\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\n### 8 week triathlon training plans free template\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\n### 8 week triathlon training plans with taper\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\n### 8 week triathlon training plans with fueling strategy\nTailor intensity and volume to your current training load, then progress weekly with recovery.\n\nRelated reading: [AI triathlon coach](/blog/ai-triathlon-coach), [adaptive training plan](/blog/ai-vs-human-coach), [best triathlon training plan](/blog/best-triathlon-training-plan).\n\nReady for your exact version?
